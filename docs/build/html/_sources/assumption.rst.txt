Assumptions & Limitations
=========================

- **Server-trusted:** The server decrypts and re-encrypts all messages (not true E2E).  
- **Controlled environment:** Assumes low packet loss (LAN).  
- **Username authentication:** Usernames are entered at startup but not cryptographically verified.
